# auth-service
An Auth Service using Azure Function with Clean Architecture.

We build this system as a part of our microservices system. In this project, we handle the auth service domain:
- Sign Up (by email, phone)
- Sign In (OAuth 2.0 with JWT)
- Change Password

## Clean Architecture
Referring to uncle Bobâ€™s Clean Architecture, we're using these layer to build our Auth Service.

### Domain Layer
This layer contains all entities, business logic, interfaces and exceptions. This layer should not depent on any technology. All other layer point on this layer, and use these entities to communicate with each other.

### Application Layer
This layer will handle all of the usecases of the system. This layer will be called by the delivery/input layer, processing the usecases, call repository layer to store the data if needed, and provide data to serve into delivery.

### Repository Layer
We devide this layer to:
- Persistence Project to CRUD data to database.
- External Services Project to CRUD data to another microservices.
- Event Publisher Project to publish event data, so that another microservices that need can use it.

### Delivery and Input Layer
In this layer, we create REST API Project to accept input from user, send the input to application layer for processing, and return the delivery data to user.
We also can add Event Handler Project to handle other microservices event, and send the data to application layer for processing. 

## Technologies
- Azure Function v3
- .NET Core 3.1
- MongoDB to store data
- Event Hub to publish events
- XUnit, FluentAssertions

## Project Structure

### src
- AuthSevice.Domain: This project is the Domain Layer
- AuthSevice.API: This project is a part of Delivery/Input Layer
- AuthSevice.Persistence: This project is a part of Repository Layer to save data to database
- AuthSevice.EventPublisher: This project is a part of Repository Layer to send new user event

### tests
- AuthService.Domain.UnitTests: Used to test the AuthSevice.Domain project
- AuthService.Persistence.IntegrationTests: Used to integration test the AuthSevice.Persistence project.
- AuthService.API.IntegrationTests: Used to integration test AuthSevice.API project. We start the AuthSevice.API, send the http request, check the http response, and also check the database.

### generator
- AuthService.GeneratorUtil: Used to generate RSA private and public keys. This keys is used to sign the JWT.

## How to Run

### AuthService.GeneratorUtil
- Set project as startup project
- Run the project

### AuthSevice.API
- Set project as startup project
- Copy local.settings.sample.json to local.settings.json
- Edit the settings value based on you settings. For example, change the DatabaseSettings:ConnectionString value with you MongoDB connection string.
- Set project as startup project
- Run the project

### AuthService.Domain.UnitTests
This test can be run without any settings.

### AuthService.AccessTokenHandler.UnitTests
This test can be run without any settings. 

### AuthSevice.Persistence.IntegrationTests
- Copy the appsettings.sample.json to appsettings.json
- Edit the settings value based on you settings. For example, change the DatabaseSettings.ConnectionString value with you MongoDB connection string.
- Run the tests!

### AuthSevice.API.IntegrationTests
- Copy the appsettings.sample.json to appsettings.json
- Edit the settings value based on you settings. For example, change the DatabaseSettings.ConnectionString value with you MongoDB connection string.
- Run the AuthService.API project manually from console. To run it manually, open your console, switch to `\src\AuthService.API\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1` directory, then run `func start`
- Run the tests!

## Depedencies
To handle authentication and authorization, this projects depends on https://github.com/tomcatsadis/azure-function-access-token-handler projects.

## Settings
### Database
We deploy the database to MongoDB Atlas. We also provide the user with readAnyDatabase role using below connection. If you want to make a write request, you must use your own database connection. Feel free to duplicate the database to your localhost or your own MongoDB Atlas.

`mongodb+srv://guest:guest@cluster0.vc8er.mongodb.net/test`
